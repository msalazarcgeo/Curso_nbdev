# Quarto 

The following project is for a course of [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/). 

**Nbdev**

Is a notebook-driven plataform to develop software. It allows to create hig-quality documentation, testm and continuous integration. 

Nbdev makes debugging and refactoring code in a simpler manner. 


* Documentation is automatically generated using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and allows to be hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The use of notebooks allow the usage of Latex inside the documentation and easy explanation of the code developed.

Here is a guide of the initial files you want to modify to remove the sections that refer to the template, leaving only what is relevant to developing/updating the material of your course.

1. Start by editing the `README.md` file carefully. 
    - Change the title
    - Remove some of the sections
    - Edit the Dev Setup instructions to cater to your needs.

2. Add your the **course code** and **course name** to the web pages
    - Using the 
    - If you are using VSCode, you can Ctrl + Shift + F (or ‚åò + Shift + F if you are on Mac) and replace all occurrences of `MY_COURSE_CODE` and `MY_COURSE_NAME` to the code and name of your course, respectively.
    - Or, you can manually edit those in the following files:
        - `_quarto.yml`
        - `2023/index.qmd`
        - `helpers/remove-nav.html`

3. Then move on to `_quarto.yml`. Scan through this file to spot what you want to change. What pages do you want to keep or remove from your website?

4. Next, modify the content of `index.qmd` and start working properly on your content pages under `2023/*`

5. To generate all the files:

    ```
    quarto preview . --render all --no-browser
    ```

# üß∞ Dev Setup

On top of the setup below, I also recommend you use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) as your primary IDE.

<details><summary>üêç The Python setup</summary>

## üêç The Python setup

1. Install [Python 3.8](python.org) or higher on your computer.
2. Install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) on your computer.
3. Create a new `conda` environment:

    ```bash
    conda create -y -n=venv-my-course python=3.10.8
    ```

    Never worked with conda environments before? Take some time to read [their documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). 

    üí° **Pro-tip**: replace `my-course` with your course code. Say, for example, `venv-ds105`.

4. Activate the environment and make sure you have `pip` installed inside that environment:

    ```bash
    # the exact `activate` command will vary depending on your OS
    conda activate venv-my-course 
    ```

üí° Remember to activate this particular `conda` environment whenever you reopen VSCode/the terminal.

10. Install required libraries

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

Now, whenever you open a Jupyter Notebook, you should see the `venv-my-course` kernel available.

<details><summary>üìä The R setup</summary>

## üìä The R setup

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of this repository.
2. Ensure you have **R version 4.2.2** or higher
3. Open the R console in this same directory and install `renv` package:
    ```r
    install.packages("renv")
    ```
4. Run `renv::restore()` to install all the packages needed for this project
5. Whenever you install a new R package, run `renv::snapshot()` to save it on your renv.

## <img src="https://quarto.org/favicon.png" style="object-fit: cover;width:1em;height:1em;" /> The Quarto setup

1. Install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html) on your computer.
2. Run the following command to start the website locally:

    ```bash
    quarto preview . --render all --no-browser
    ```
    This will read the instructions from `_quarto.yml` and render the website locally.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<port>/`. That's it!

<details><summary>üï∏Ô∏è Publishing the website</summary>

## üï∏Ô∏è Publishing the website

I recommend you set up a **GitHub Action** for this. Just follow the instructions in the official [Quarto instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-action).

üí° This template already comes with a GitHub workflow setup. You can find it in the [.github/workflows/publish.yml_](.github/workflows/publish.yml_) file. You just need to rename it to `.github/workflows/publish.yml` (remove the underscore at the end)
